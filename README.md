### 1.3 Design 
    
- #### Colour Scheme

- #### Fonts
The **Preahvihear font** is used throughout the whole website for all text. sans serif is the fallback in case the main font isn't being imported to the site correctly. I used this font because it's easy to look at.

- #### Icons
In this project the icons used are provided by [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The icons used have a practical and functional purpose for example the magnifying glass icon for the search box. They also give character to the website.

- #### Images
The images I used for this project came mostly from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/): 
- The background image: [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) uploaded by: [Leah Kelley](https://www.pexels.com/nl-nl/@leah-kelley-50725). 

- #### Defensive design 

    

- #### Interactive design 

    - The website has to be easy to navigate. 
    - The user can quickly find the information he/she wants to find.

<h1>5. Deployment</h1>

#### Requirements 
- Python3 
- Github account 
- Heroku account

#### Clone the project 
To make a local clone, follow the following steps. 
1. Log in to GitHub and go to the repository. 
2. Click on the green button with the text **“Code”.**
3. Click on **“Open with GitHub Desktop”** and follow the prompts in the GitHub Desktop Application or follow the instructions from **[this link](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop)** to see how to clone the repository in other ways. 

#### Working with the local copy
1. Install all the requirements: Go to the workspace of your local copy. In the terminal window of your IDE type: **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**.
2. Create a database in MongoDB  
    - Signup or login to your MongoDB account.
    - Create a cluster and a database.
    - Create four collections in the db: **categories, recipes, subscribers, users.**
    - Add string values for the collections. See <a href="#ux-architecture">my Information architecture</a> how the database is set up for this project.
3. Create the environment variables 
    - Create a .gitignore file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add the env.py file in the .gitignore.
    - Create the file env.py. This  will contain all the envornment variables.
    ```
    Import os
    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "Added by developer")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "Added by developer")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "Added by developer")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "Added by developer")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "Added by developer")
    ```
4. Run the app: Open your terminal window in your IDE. Type python3 app.py and run the app.

#### Heroku Deployment  
1. Set up local workspace for Heroku 
    - In terminal window of your IDE type: **pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt.** (The file is needed for Heroku to know which filed to install.)
    - In termial window of your IDE type: **python app.py > Procfile** (The file is needed for Heroku to know which file is needed as entry point.)
2. Set up Heroku: create a Heroku account and create a new app and select your region. 
3. Deployment method 'Github'
    - Click on the **Connect to GitHub** section in the deploy tab in Heroku. 
        - Search your repository to connect with it.
        - When your repository appears click on **connect** to connect your repository with the Heroku. 
    - Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to **Config Vars**. Click on **Reveal Config Vars**.
        - Enter the variables contained in your env.py file. it is about: **IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME**
4. Push the requirements.txt and Procfile to repository. 
     ```
    $ git add requirements.txt
    $ git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"

    $ git add Procfile 
    $ git commit -m "Add Procfile"
    ```
5. Automatic deployment: Go to the deploy tab in Heroku and scroll down to **Aotmatic deployments**. Click on **Enable Automatic Deploys**. By **Manual deploy** click on **Deploy Branch**.

Heroku will receive the code from Github and host the app using the required packages. 
Click on **Open app** in the right corner of your Heroku account. The app wil open and the live link is available from the address bar.
